Answers:

1. I have already had snacks.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "had already done" ❌ → "have already had" ✅

We don’t say "do refreshments." Instead, we use "have" for meals/snacks.
2️⃣ "refreshments" ❌ → "breakfast/snacks" ✅

"Refreshments" refers to drinks and light snacks at an event.
If you mean a meal, say "I have already had breakfast/lunch/dinner."
If you mean a snack, say "I have already had snacks.")


2. By the time he arrived at the office, I had already completed the work.

3. Why are you sitting here?
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "siting" ❌ → "sitting" ✅
"Siting" is incorrect; the correct spelling is "sitting" (present continuous tense).)

4. If you worked hard, you would be successful.

5. I don't need to know which city he was living in.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "in which city he was living?" ❌ → "which city he was living in." ✅
In English, prepositions (like "in") usually go at the end of the sentence when using indirect questions.
3️⃣ "don't have to" vs. "don't need to"
"Don't need to" means it's unnecessary. ✅
"Don't have to" also means it's not required, but "don't need to" sounds more natural here.)

6. I was thinking about buying a gift for my sister's birthday. 
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "about buy" ❌ → "about buying" ✅
After "thinking about," we use a gerund (-ing form), so "buying" is correct.)

7. I recently bought a new bicycle.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "buy" ❌ → "bought" ✅
"Recently" refers to the past, so we need the past tense of "buy" → "bought."
2️⃣ "cycle" ❌ → "bicycle" ✅
In English, "cycle" is usually a verb ("I cycle to work").
The correct noun for a vehicle is "bicycle" (or "bike" in informal speech).)

8. He has been talking on phone for the last three hours.

9. I wanted to go to paris.

10. I have been preparing for the exam for the last five months.
10. I have been preparing for my exam for five months.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "doing preparation" ❌ → "preparing" ✅
Instead of "doing preparation," use the verb "preparing" (more natural).
2️⃣ "last five months" ❌ → "for the last five months" ✅
We use "for" to indicate a duration of time (for five months).)

Answers:

11. Have you ever felt strange?

12. My old friend met me, while I was going to my school. 
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "was met me" ❌ → "met me" ✅
"Met" is the past tense of "meet." We don’t use "was met" because "meet" is an active verb, not passive.
2️⃣ "had went" ❌ → "had gone" (or just "was going") ✅
"Had went" is incorrect because the past perfect tense requires "had + past participle" (so it should be "had gone").
But "was going" fits better because the action was in progress when the friend met you.
3️⃣ "to my school" ❌ → "to school" ✅
We say "go to school" (without "my") unless we are referring to a specific school as possession (e.g., "to my old school").)

13. You will get illness if you don't take require rest.

14. I feel like maybe we need to go for long ride.

15. Recently, he went to the hospital with his mom.

17. He has been looking a new home in this city.
(Use looking -> finding)

18. I tried to eat chinese food yet, I didn't like it.
(Why "was tried" is incorrect?
"Was tried" suggests a passive voice, which doesn’t fit here.
"Try" is an active verb, meaning you are performing the action.
Correct Usage:
Active voice: ✅ "I tried to eat Chinese food." (You performed the action.)
Passive voice: ❌ "I was tried to eat Chinese food." (Incorrect because "was tried" suggests someone else tried you, which doesn’t make sense.)
When do we use "was + past participle"?
Passive voice:
✅ "He was tried in court." (Meaning, a judge tried him in court.)
✅ "The book was written by an author.")


19. If you want to meet the prist, then let me first know.

20. I was always ready to help my friends.

Answers:

21. I had already read that book.

22. We opened a new restaurant last year.
(Why is "had opened" incorrect?
1️⃣ "Had opened" (Past Perfect) is used when there is another past event after it.
	Example: ✅ "We had opened a new restaurant before the pandemic started." (Two past events)
2️⃣ "Last year" already indicates a specific past time, so Simple Past ("opened") is correct.
	✅ "We opened a new restaurant last year." (No need for Past Perfect))

23. Have you ever been to a live concert?
(2️⃣ "Gone to" vs. "Been to"
✅ "Have you ever been to a live concert?" (More natural in everyday English.)
"Been to" is commonly used when talking about experiences.
"Gone to" is used when the person is still at that place:
✅ "He has gone to a concert." (Meaning, he is still there.))

24. If you had listened to my talk, you would have not fallen into trouble.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "had listen" ❌ → "had listened" ✅
After "had", we need the past participle form (listened).
2️⃣ "you not fall" ❌ → "you would not have fallen" ✅
In Third Conditional (imaginary past), use "would have + past participle".
"fall" (present) → "fallen" (past participle).)

25. My sister is too good at puzzle solving.

26. In the future, I want to buy a new car.
(My dream is to buy a new car in the future.)

27. We will go on a picnic if the weather is good.

28. I want to join a new gym for a month.

29. Have you ever been outside the country?

30. My mother isn't at home, as she has gone to meet her friend.
(Corrections:
1️⃣ "doesn't at home" ❌ → "isn't at home" ✅
"Isn't" (short for "is not") is the correct form to describe the current situation (present).
"Doesn't" is used with verbs, not to describe location.
2️⃣ "owing she has been going" ❌ → "as she has gone" ✅
"Owing" is incorrect in this context. We should use "as" to show the reason.
"Has gone" is correct for an action that happened in the past and has an effect now (present perfect).
"Has been going" would imply ongoing action, but it's not the right choice here since she has already gone.)
