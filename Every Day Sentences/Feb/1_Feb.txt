Answers: 

1. When I went out side, it started raining.
("was went" → corrected to "went"

"Was went" is incorrect because "went" is already the past tense of "go."
We do not use "was" before a simple past verb.
✅ Correct: When I went outside,
❌ Incorrect: When I was went outside,
"getting started" → corrected to "started raining"

"Getting started" is incorrect in this context.
The correct phrase is "it started raining.")

2. She was laughing so loudly that everyone could heared it.

3. If you work hard, you will surely achieve success.
(Missing "will" before "achieve"
In future conditional sentences, we generally use "will" in the result clause.

4. As long as you keep working hard, you will achieve success.

5. He told me that he was a good friend of mine.
("He said me" → corrected to "He told me"

"Say" does not take a direct object (like "me") in this context.
"Tell" is used when there is a direct object (someone receiving the information).
✅ Correct: "He told me..."
❌ Incorrect: "He said me...")

6. I need a job but in a good company.

7. He told me that he would come again.
(why would used here? 
Her original statement (in the past): "I will come again." (Future from her perspective at that time)
Reporting her statement (later, also in the past): "She said that she would come again." (Future from her perspective, but reported in the past by the speaker))

8. If you are worried all the time, then you will never be able to grow.
("If you are worried all the time, you will never be able to grow."	A real possibility in the present/future. (If this happens, that will happen.)
"If you were worried all the time, you would never be able to grow."	A hypothetical (imaginary) situation. 
													(You're not actually worried all the time, but if you were, then this 	would be true.)

9. when I arrived, all members were already present.
By the time I arrived, everyone was alredy there..

10. He promises that he will come on time.

The subject "He" is third-person singular (he/she/it).
In the present simple tense, verbs take an "-s" in the third-person singular.
✅ Correct: "He promises..."
❌ Incorrect: "He promise..."
"at time" → corrected to "on time"

"At time" is incorrect in this context.
The correct phrase is "on time", which means punctually, not late.
