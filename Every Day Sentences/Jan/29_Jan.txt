Answer:

1. When it started raining, we went home.
("was start" → corrected to "started": The correct past tense form is "started" (not "was start").
"are go" → corrected to "went": "Went" is the correct past tense of "go."
"to home" → corrected to "home": We usually say "went home" instead of "went to home.")

2. If you make an effort, you will succeed.
("give effort" → corrected to "make an effort": The correct collocation is "make an effort," not "give effort."
"get the success" → corrected to "succeed": "Succeed" is a more natural verb here. Alternatively, you could say "achieve success" or "get success" (without "the").)

3. I got to know that you spoke truth.
("I getting knew" → corrected to "I got to know":
"Getting knew" is incorrect because "knew" is past tense, and "getting" doesn't fit here.
"Got to know" means "came to know" or "realized."
"speaked" → corrected to "spoke":
"Speaked" is incorrect because "speak" is an irregular verb. The correct past tense is "spoke."
"truth" → corrected to "the truth":
"The truth" is the correct phrase when referring to a specific truth.)

4. I'll go to play after completting my homework.
("go for play" → corrected to "go to play":
The correct phrase is "go to play", not "go for play" because "play" is a verb here.
If you meant a noun, you could say "go for a game" or "go for a play" (if referring to a theater play).
"completting" → corrected to "completing":(single "t").)

5. He is rich at heart even though he was poor.		OR 		He is rich at heart even though he was is poor.
("rich from his heart" → corrected to "rich at heart":
The correct phrase is "rich at heart", which means he has a kind and generous nature.)

6. I went there where they invited me.
("went there where" → corrected to "went where":
"There" is unnecessary because "where" already indicates a place.)

7. If you speak the true then it will be good for you.

8. It is good for you to wake up early.

9. I will be waiting for you until you come back.

10. He told me that he was a good friend of mine.


11. I'll go although you not coming with me.
("you are not come" → corrected to "you are not coming":
"Come" should be in the present continuous form "coming" because "are" requires an -ing verb.
Alternatively, you could say "you do not come", but "you are not coming" sounds more natural.)

12. Buy whatever you like.
("Whatever you like buy it" → corrected to "Buy whatever you like."
The phrase "whatever you like" already includes the idea of what you want to buy, so adding "it" is unnecessary.
In English, the correct word order is verb + object, so "buy" should come first.)

13. He always does that which no one has thought of.
( previously: He always do that which noone have thought.

"do" → corrected to "does"

The subject "He" is third-person singular, so the verb should be "does" instead of "do."
"noone" → corrected to "no one"

"Noone" is incorrect. The correct spelling is "no one" (two words).
"have" → corrected to "has"

The subject "no one" is singular, so we use "has" instead of "have."
Added "of" after "thought"

The phrase "thought of" is the correct usage in English.)

14. If you not lose courage, then you'll surly win.
હિંમત - courage 
હારશો - lose

15. Even though he was rich, he was kind.
Although he is rich, he is kind.

17. I went there where I found peace.
(instead of use 'got' use 'found' for more natural pronoun.)

18. Even though he was alone, he was never sad.

19. When I was studying, my mom was cooking food.
("was studied" → corrected to "was studying":
When referring to an action happening in the past, you use the past continuous tense with was/were + -ing form.
"Studied" is the simple past tense, but you need "studying" (past continuous) to match the ongoing nature of the action in the past.
could use 'making' or 'cooking' both)

20. If you are not aware, then it will cause you trouble.
(Problem, conseqences, trouble)
